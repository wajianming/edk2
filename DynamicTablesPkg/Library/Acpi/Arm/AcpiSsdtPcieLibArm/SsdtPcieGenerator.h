    A CM_ARM_PCI_CONFIG_SPACE_INFO structure references two CM_ARM_OBJ_REF:
     - one for the address mapping, referencing
       CM_ARM_PCI_ADDRESS_MAP_INFO structures.
     - one for the interrupt mapping, referencing
       CM_ARM_PCI_INTERRUPT_MAP_INFO structures.

    The CM_ARM_PCI_INTERRUPT_MAP_INFO objects cannot be handled individually.
    Device's Pci legacy interrupts that are mapped to the same CPU interrupt
    are grouped under a Link device.
    For instance, the following mapping:
     - [INTA of device 0] mapped on [GIC irq 168]
     - [INTB of device 1] mapped on [GIC irq 168]
    will be represented in an SSDT table as:
     - [INTA of device 0] mapped on [Link device A]
     - [INTB of device 1] mapped on [Link device A]
     - [Link device A] mapped on [GIC irq 168]

    Counting the number of Cpu interrupts used and grouping them in Link
    devices is done through this IRQ_TABLE.

    ASL code:
    Scope (_SB) {
      Device (LNKA) {
        [...]
        Name (_PRS, ResourceTemplate () {
          Interrupt (ResourceProducer, Level, ActiveHigh, Exclusive) { 168 }
        })
